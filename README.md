# **Googl Search 2.0**
This project was created following a tutorial from [Javscript Mastery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDbruK1fzG8).In this project I implemented a very minimalist version of the Google Search Home view.
Some of the things I learned  from the tutorial include

- Working with an API from Rapid API
- Using React Context API for managing global states
- A good knowledge of how to use TailwindCSS for creating responsive sites
